Ok, that’s a little extreme, but the frustration I experienced transitioning from Rails to Javascript  felt like death was the easier choice at times. 

I was on a high-note after my rails project, as I feel I have a good grasp of what is going on with the backend. While this definitely helped with Javascript, it was still very challenging as a lot of things changed. It took trial and error, continuous re-reading of Flatiron material, many google searches (MDN Web Docs is a life-saver) and help from a very patient Flatiron instructor before things starting to make sense.

The application that I decided to make for my Javascript project is called Card Collector. It allows a person to document all of the trading cards that they’ve collected, from sports cards to Pokemon cards, any trading card is fair game. This allows an individual to have a quick reference to what they’ve collected without having to go through the cards themselves. My project has a rails-api backend working jointly with a javascript frontend, allowing for a great user experience. The javascript frontend allows a person to add a collection and then add cards to that collection. The information that is entered ultimately gets saved to a database, provided by the rails-api backend. 

Although my application is fairly basic, I intend to add additional features in the future, but I’ve been able to meet all of the project requirements. As with all of the other projects, bringing everything you’ve learned within each section to create your own application is where everything has come together for me. Working through my own bugs and finding solutions has really reinforced the information that is being covered. I look forward to continuing my javascript knowledge, as the possibilities for providing a great user-experience are endless.

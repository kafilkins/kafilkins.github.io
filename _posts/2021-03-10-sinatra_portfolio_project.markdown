It's incredible to think that I'm now up to my 2nd portfolio project with Flatiron School. It's been a roller coaster ride so far. There have been times that I wanted to just give up, as I wasn't understanding things but with a little determination and perseverance, here I am completing my 2nd project. 

With this 2nd portfolio project, we were tasked with creating a Sinatra web application, that had CRUD functionality, while using common MVC methodology. The application that I created is called Globe Trotter. It allows a user to chronicle their trips during their life. A user can sign up, by creating a username and password. Then, they can create a new trip, adding a location, description and adventures they experience. The user has the ability to create new trips, edit existing trips and also delete any trips they would like to forget about. A user can also view all of the trips that exist within the database, but are not allowed to edit or delete anyone elses trips, besides their own. 

I wanted to keep my application basic, as I was having a little trouble understanding all of the moving parts associated with creating a web application. The feeling of accomplishment that came over me once I had all of my routes working correctly was amazing. This has been a tough journey, but the small wins of getting things working make it all worth it. Iâ€™m looking forward to moving on in the course and continuing to broaden my coding skills. There is still A LOT of work to be done.

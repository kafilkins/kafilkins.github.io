Here we are with another blog after completing my rails project. I was so confident going into it, as I felt I had a solid grasp of the content after completing the module. Boy was I in for a rude awaking. 

The struggle began trying to decide on an idea of what to create. I went back and forth with a bunch of different ideas but always found flaws. The application I created is called Landscaper. Landscaper is a fictional Rails application that allows a landscaping company to receive job orders for customers. A customer can go to the website and put in an job request, indicating which tasks they require for the job. An employee can also sign in and view what jobs they have available. Only employees have the ability to alter jobs, once they've been created. Employees can go and edit a job to complete. This will help keep track of what jobs are complete and what is still open. 

This project helped me to better understand the inner-workings of a rails application. From creating models and assocations, to creating controllers & views, to finally battling with HTML & CSS, I can honestly say that although I have a long way to go, I've enjoyed the trials and tribulations that I've experiened and look forward to making other applications.

I'm looking forward to moving on in the course and expanding my programming skills and seeing whatelse I can create after coming in with no programming skills at all.

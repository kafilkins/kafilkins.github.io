*      I'm actually a newbie to programming in general. After being in a sales position over the last 10 years, I thought it was time to make a career change. After a lot of thinking and researching, I decided to enroll with Flatiron School, as they offered a "self-paced" option. I'm still employed working as an Account Executive, so finding time to learn a whole new skill from scratch has been challenging to say the least. Although I've ran into difficulties, it has only increased my interest in programming and has made the small victories of getting things working that much more exhilarating. 
		 
*      It's been about 3 months since I've started down this journey of learning to code. After working through plenty of read a longs and labs, it finally came time to work on my own project. I wanted to choose something that interested me and would keep me engaged, as I knew it would be challenging. I've always had a passion for sneakers so I figured I would make an application that provides the user with information about the latest Air Jordan sneakers releases. The first challenge I experienced was finding the right page to scrape the information I would need. I wanted to be able to provide the user with the sneaker titles that would release in a given month and then provide the release dates for those sneakers. A lot of the web pages I found were not formatted very nicely but luckily I came across one that worked for the information that I needed. 
		 
* 		 My next challenge was creating the flow of my application. I wanted to keep it simple for the user but ensure that I was providing the most accurate data. Here is the flow I settled on; once the user started the app, he would be greeted and then a list of months (January-June) would appear. The user would then select a month and be given the name of the sneaker releases for that month. Then the user would have the option to see the exact release dates for the sneakers in that month, go back to the list of months to select a new month or exit. 
		 
* 		 Once I settled on the flow of the program, I began to build the classes that I would need in order to store my information. I created a Sneaker class that would hold my sneaker title, the release month and the release day. I then began working on my Scraper class that would retrieve all of the information that I needed. Getting these two classes working properly was probably the most challenging aspect of this project.
		 
* 		 I can truly say that creating this application from scratch, really helped me to better understand object orientation, how classes work together, how to properly store attributes within classes and then be able to call upon those attributes. It really re-enforced a lot of the knowledge that was still a bit fuzzy to me going through the read a longâ€™s and the labs. I look forward to continuing my journey and improving upon the new skills I have established.
